### Rules of the game

- Two players "X" and "O" compete to drop their tokens into the columns to create four in a row
- The game ends in one of two ways:
  - One player gets four of their tokens in a row, column or diagonal before the other
  - The board is full of tokens with no clear winner, this is a draw
